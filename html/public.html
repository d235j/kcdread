    <h1>KCDRead - Reading Kurzweil Media</h1>

    <h3>Open Source Project</h3>

    <p>The Kurzweil samplers of the K2x00 series are on the market 
      for a long time now, proving that quality persists.</p>

    <p>As time has gone by, the hardware environment changed. Hard disks
      became larger and CD Roms faster. Unfortunately, the K doesn't really
      know how to work with new drives.</p>
    
    <p>This Project is intended for solving this gap. The Kurzweil's filesystem 
      is quite near to the old MSDOS FAT16 standard. It's not too hard to decode
      it.</p>

    <p>There's already a free Win32 program that reads K2x00-CDs using Adaptec's
      Aspi-functions (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/mhalbrue/kcompact/kimage.htm">KCdRead Win32</a>).
      I decided to publish the decoding algo with the intention that other 
      platforms can be supported, too.</p>

    <p>Writing a GUI would also be nice, perhaps we can merge the KCDRead code 
      with a filebrowser. Feel free to make suggestions.</p>
